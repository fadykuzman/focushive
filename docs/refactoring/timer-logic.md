# Refactoring timerlogic.js for Clean Code, Testability, and Maintainability

Clean Code Issues:
  - [ ] Mixed import/export placement (imports after exports, line 17)
  - [ ] Inconsistent parameter destructuring in completeTimerTransition - extracts individual properties instead of using the durations object pattern used elsewhere
  - [ ] Magic numbers without clear context (1000 in calculateElapsedTime)
  - [ ] Complex nested ternary logic in completeTimerTransition that's hard to read

  Testability Issues:
  - [ ] Static methods with Date.now() dependency make time-based testing difficult without mocking
  - [ ] calculateElapsedTime and restoration logic are tightly coupled to system time
  - [ ] No dependency injection - hard to test time calculations in isolation
  - [ ] Complex conditional logic in completeTimerTransition would need extensive test cases

  Maintainability Issues:
  - [ ] Tight coupling to TimerRestoration class without clear interface contract
  - [ ] Mixed responsibilities - handles both timer calculations and state transitions
  - [ ] Parameter shapes vary between methods (some expect full state, others specific fields)
  - [ ] No error handling for edge cases (negative durations, invalid states)
  - [ ] The class name suggests pure logic but contains stateful dependencies

  The code would benefit from dependency injection for time functions, clearer separation of concerns, consistent parameter patterns, and
  better error handling.
