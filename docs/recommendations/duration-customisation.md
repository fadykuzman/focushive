# Presentation Alternatives

  1. Settings Modal/Popup

  - Gear icon button that opens overlay modal
  - Grouped inputs for each timer type (Focus, Short Break, Long Break)
  - Save/Cancel buttons
  - Pros: Clean, doesn't clutter main UI, familiar pattern
  - Cons: Extra clicks to access, settings hidden from view

  2. Settings Sidebar

  - Slide-out panel from right/left side
  - Always accessible via hamburger menu or settings icon
  - Real-time preview of changes
  - Pros: More space for controls, can show advanced options
  - Cons: Takes screen real estate, mobile responsive challenges

  3. Inline Settings Panel

  - Collapsible section below timer controls
  - Toggle button "Customize Durations" to expand/collapse
  - Immediate visibility when expanded
  - Pros: No navigation needed, contextual
  - Cons: Can make interface busy, longer page

  4. Settings Page/Route

  - Dedicated page /settings
  - Comprehensive controls with categories
  - Breadcrumb navigation back to timer
  - Pros: Unlimited space, organized sections
  - Cons: Context switching, more complex navigation

## Logic Alternatives


  1. Live Updates During Session ⭐ RECOMMENDED

  - Immediate effect on current running timer
  - Time adjusts dynamically - if you change 25→30 min with 10 min left, it becomes 15 min left
  - Proportional scaling maintains progress ratio
  - Pros: Immediate feedback, flexible mid-session adjustments
  - Cons: Can be confusing if user doesn't expect it

  2. Live Updates with Progress Preservation

  - Immediate effect but elapsed time stays same
  - If 15 min elapsed in 25 min session → changing to 30 min gives 15 min remaining
  - Absolute time tracking rather than proportional
  - Pros: Predictable behavior, no lost progress
  - Cons: Can result in weird progress bar states

  3. Live Updates with User Confirmation

  - Show preview of what new time would be
  - "Apply change to current session?" prompt
  - Default to yes for seamless experience
  - Pros: User awareness, prevents accidents
  - Cons: Extra friction, interrupts flow

## Client-Side Persistence Alternatives

  1. localStorage

  - Simple key-value storage
  - JSON serialization for settings object
  - ~5-10MB limit per domain
  - Pros: Simple API, widely supported, synchronous
  - Cons: Can be cleared by user/browser, limited storage

  2. IndexedDB

  - Structured database in browser
  - Larger storage limits (~50MB+)
  - Transaction-based operations
  - Pros: More robust, handles complex data, offline-first
  - Cons: Async API complexity, overkill for simple settings

  3. Web Storage API + Backup

  - localStorage as primary storage
  - Export/Import functionality for settings
  - JSON file download/upload for backup
  - Pros: User control over data, migration friendly
  - Cons: Manual backup process, file management

  4. Cookie-based

  - HTTP cookies for settings
  - Server-readable if needed later
  - 4KB limit per cookie
  - Pros: Server accessible, persistent across devices (with sync)
  - Cons: Size limitations, sent with every request

  5. URL Parameters

  - Settings encoded in URL hash/params
  - Shareable configurations via links
  - Bookmarkable custom setups
  - Pros: Shareable, no storage needed, works anywhere
  - Cons: URL gets long, limited data types, not user-friendly

## Recommended Approache

  Presentation: Settings modal with gear icon (matches pomofocus.io exactly)
  Logic: Live updates during session with proportional scaling (pomofocus.io behavior)
  Persistence: localStorage with the current session state included

  This provides the same intuitive experience as pomofocus.io where users can adjust durations on-the-fly and see immediate results.
