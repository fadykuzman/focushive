# Automatic Semantic Versioning Implementation Plan

## Current State Analysis
- Project version: 0.1.0 (private package)
- Existing CI/CD: GitHub Actions with test/build/deploy pipeline
- Git hooks: Husky pre-commit with lint-staged
- Commit pattern: Currently informal messages

## Recommended Approach: Semantic-Release + Conventional Commits

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup
1. **Install semantic-release dependencies**:
   - `semantic-release` (core)
   - `@semantic-release/changelog` (changelog generation)
   - `@semantic-release/git` (git operations)
   - `@commitlint/cli` and `@commitlint/config-conventional` (commit message linting)

2. **Configure conventional commit enforcement**:
   - Add commitlint configuration
   - Update Husky to run commitlint on commit-msg hook
   - Add commitizen for guided commit messages (optional)

### Phase 2: Semantic-Release Configuration
3. **Create .releaserc.json** with plugins:
   - Analyze commits for version bumps
   - Generate changelog from commits
   - Update package.json version
   - Create git tags and releases

4. **Update GitHub Actions CI/CD**:
   - Add semantic-release job that runs after successful tests
   - Configure GitHub token permissions for releases
   - Only run on main branch pushes

### Phase 3: Documentation & Testing
5. **Create ADR** documenting the decision and alternatives considered
6. **Update contributing guidelines** with conventional commit format
7. **Test with sample commits** to verify automation works

## Alternative Approaches Considered

### Option 1: Semantic-Release âœ… **RECOMMENDED**
**Description**: Fully automated versioning based on conventional commits
**Pros**:
- Industry standard for automated releases
- Integrates well with existing GitHub Actions
- Automatic changelog generation
- Works with existing CI/CD pipeline
- Zero manual intervention needed

**Cons**:
- Learning curve for conventional commits
- Less control over release timing
- Requires proper commit message discipline

### Option 2: Standard-Version
**Description**: Semi-automated versioning with manual release control
**Pros**:
- Manual control over when releases happen
- Good for teams wanting review before release
- Simpler setup than semantic-release
- Local-only changes until manual push

**Cons**:
- Requires manual npm run release commands
- No automatic publishing
- Still prone to human error in release process

### Option 3: GitVersion
**Description**: Flow-based versioning using git branch patterns
**Pros**:
- Works well with GitFlow workflows
- Calculates versions from branch structure
- Good for complex branching strategies
- Compatible with various CI systems

**Cons**:
- More complex setup
- Requires specific branching strategy
- May not fit current simple workflow
- Less commonly used in JavaScript ecosystem

### Option 4: Manual Versioning (Current State)
**Description**: Manual package.json version updates
**Pros**:
- Full control over versioning
- Simple to understand
- No additional tooling needed

**Cons**:
- Error-prone process
- Inconsistent version bumps
- Manual changelog maintenance
- Time-consuming release process

## Implementation Details

### Conventional Commit Format
```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

**Types**:
- `feat`: A new feature (minor version bump)
- `fix`: A bug fix (patch version bump)
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that do not affect code meaning
- `refactor`: Code change that neither fixes bug nor adds feature
- `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `chore`: Changes to build process or auxiliary tools

**Breaking Changes**: Add `BREAKING CHANGE:` in footer or `!` after type (major version bump)

### Semantic-Release Configuration
```json
{
  "branches": ["main"],
  "plugins": [
    "@semantic-release/commit-analyzer",
    "@semantic-release/release-notes-generator",
    "@semantic-release/changelog",
    "@semantic-release/npm",
    "@semantic-release/github",
    "@semantic-release/git"
  ]
}
```

### GitHub Actions Integration
- Add `GITHUB_TOKEN` with appropriate permissions
- Run semantic-release after successful test/build
- Automatically create GitHub releases with generated notes
- Update package.json and create tags

## Benefits
- **Automatic version bumps** based on commit types (feat: minor, fix: patch, BREAKING CHANGE: major)
- **Generated changelogs** from commit messages
- **Consistent release process** across all team members
- **No manual version management errors**
- **Clear commit history** with enforced conventional format
- **GitHub releases** with automatic release notes

## Migration Strategy
1. Start with current informal commits
2. Add commitlint to enforce conventional format going forward
3. Configure semantic-release for automatic releases
4. Team training on conventional commit format
5. Monitor and adjust configuration as needed

## Implementation Effort
- **Complexity**: Low-medium
- **Time**: 2-3 hours setup + team training
- **Risk**: Low (can be reversed easily)
- **Dependencies**: None beyond npm packages

## Success Metrics
- Zero manual version bump errors
- Consistent changelog generation
- Faster release cycles
- Improved commit message quality
- Automated GitHub releases
