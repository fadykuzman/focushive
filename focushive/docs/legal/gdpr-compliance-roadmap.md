# GDPR Compliance Roadmap for FocusHive

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requirements for FocusHive at different stages of product development, from the current local-only timer application to a full-featured platform with user accounts and centralized data storage.

## Current Product Analysis (Stage 1: Local-Only Timer)

### Data Processing Assessment
**Current State**: FocusHive is a client-side Pomodoro timer application with minimal data processing.

**Data Collected**:
- Timer settings (focus duration, break durations, total rounds)
- Timer state (current time, active status, current round, mode)
- User preferences (auto timer start setting)

**Storage Method**: 
- Local browser storage via Zustand persist middleware
- Data stored in browser's localStorage under key "focushive-timer"
- No server transmission or external data processing

**Third-Party Services**:
- Google Fonts (Inter font family) - IP address may be shared with Google
- No analytics, tracking, or external data collection currently implemented

### GDPR Requirements - Stage 1 (Current)

#### ‚úÖ MINIMAL COMPLIANCE NEEDED
Since data is stored locally and not transmitted, GDPR requirements are minimal:

1. **Transparency (Articles 12-14)**
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è **RECOMMENDED**: Add privacy notice explaining local data storage
   - No explicit consent required for local storage of functional data

2. **Data Minimization (Article 5(1)(c))**
   - ‚úÖ **COMPLIANT**: Only essential timer data is stored

3. **Storage Limitation (Article 5(1)(e))**
   - ‚úÖ **COMPLIANT**: Data persists only for application functionality

4. **Google Fonts Consideration**
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è **LOW RISK**: EU courts have ruled on Google Fonts IP transmission
   - **RECOMMENDATION**: Consider self-hosting fonts or adding notice

#### Immediate Actions Required: NONE (Minimal risk)
#### Recommended Actions:
- Add basic privacy notice for transparency
- Consider self-hosting Google Fonts
