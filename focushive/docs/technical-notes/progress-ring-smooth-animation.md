# Progress Ring Smooth Animation Fix

## Problem Description

The progress ring component exhibited snappy behavior where it would move smoothly for some seconds but occasionally snap to the next position instead of smoothly progressing.

## Root Cause Analysis

### The Issue
1. **Discrete Timer Updates**: The timer store decrements `timeLeft` by 1 second at exact 1000ms intervals
2. **CSS Transition Mismatch**: ProgressRing had a 1000ms CSS transition (`transition-all duration-1000 ease-linear`)
3. **Re-render Timing**: React re-renders immediately when `timeLeft` changes, causing the progress to jump discretely
4. **Timing Inconsistency**: The combination of discrete state updates and CSS transitions created visual inconsistencies

### Why It Happened Sometimes
- Browser performance variations
- JavaScript event loop timing
- React rendering cycle timing
- CSS transition completion timing mismatches

## Solution Implementation

### 1. Sub-Second Progress Interpolation
Added smooth progress interpolation using `requestAnimationFrame`:

```javascript
const [smoothProgress, setSmoothProgress] = useState(0);

useEffect(() => {
  let animationFrame = null;
  const startTime = Date.now();
  const targetProgress = ((getModeDuration(mode) - timeLeft) / getModeDuration(mode)) * 100;

  const updateSmoothProgress = () => {
    if (isActive && !isPaused && timeLeft > 0) {
      const elapsed = (Date.now() - startTime) / 1000;
      const interpolatedProgress = targetProgress + (elapsed / getModeDuration(mode)) * 100;
      setSmoothProgress(Math.min(interpolatedProgress, 100));
      animationFrame = requestAnimationFrame(updateSmoothProgress);
    } else {
      setSmoothProgress(targetProgress);
    }
  };

  updateSmoothProgress();
  return () => {
    if (animationFrame) {
      cancelAnimationFrame(animationFrame);
    }
  };
}, [timeLeft, isActive, isPaused, mode, focusDuration, shortBreakDuration, longBreakDuration]);
```

### 2. Removed CSS Transitions
Removed the CSS transition from ProgressRing component since smooth updates are now handled by JavaScript:

```javascript
// Before
className="transition-all duration-1000 ease-linear"

// After  
// No className - smooth updates handled by requestAnimationFrame
```

### 3. Continuous Updates
- `requestAnimationFrame` provides smooth 60fps updates
- Progress interpolates between discrete timer states
- No more dependency on CSS transition timing

## Benefits

1. **Consistent Smoothness**: Progress ring always moves smoothly regardless of browser performance
2. **Better Performance**: No CSS transition overhead
3. **Precise Control**: JavaScript-controlled animation timing
4. **Eliminated Snapping**: No more discrete jumps between timer states

## Technical Details

- **Update Rate**: 60fps via `requestAnimationFrame`
- **Calculation**: Linear interpolation between current and next timer states
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup of animation frames to prevent memory leaks
- **State Management**: Smooth progress state separate from discrete timer state

## Edge Cases Handled

- Timer pause/resume: Animation stops/starts appropriately
- Mode switches: Progress resets correctly for new mode
- Timer completion: Progress reaches exactly 100%
- Component unmount: Animation frames properly cancelled
