# ADR 006: IndexedDB for Session History and Statistics

## Status
Accepted

## Context
FocusHive needs to implement session history and productivity statistics to provide users with insights into their focus patterns and productivity trends. This requires storing and querying historical session data locally while maintaining the app's privacy-first, local-only architecture.

## Decision
We will use IndexedDB as the primary storage solution for session history and statistics data.

## Rationale

### Storage Requirements Analysis
- **Data Volume**: Potentially thousands of session records over time
- **Query Complexity**: Need to filter by date ranges, session types, and completion status
- **Data Relationships**: Sessions related to daily/weekly/monthly aggregations
- **Performance**: Real-time statistics calculations and trend analysis

### Storage Options Considered

#### 1. localStorage (Rejected)
- **Pros**: Simple API, existing infrastructure in place
- **Cons**: 
  - Limited storage capacity (~5-10MB)
  - String-only storage requires JSON parsing overhead
  - No native querying capabilities
  - Synchronous operations block UI
  - Poor performance with large datasets

#### 2. IndexedDB (Selected)
- **Pros**:
  - Large storage capacity (gigabytes)
  - Asynchronous operations (non-blocking)
  - Native support for complex data types
  - Indexed queries for fast data retrieval
  - Transaction support for data integrity
  - Built-in schema versioning and migration
- **Cons**: 
  - More complex API
  - Requires wrapper for ease of use
  - Browser compatibility considerations (though well-supported)

#### 3. WebSQL (Rejected)
- **Cons**: Deprecated by all major browsers

### Implementation Benefits
1. **Scalability**: Can handle years of session data without performance degradation
2. **Query Performance**: Indexed access for date-based queries and filtering
3. **Data Integrity**: Transaction support ensures consistent data state
4. **Future-Proof**: Supports complex analytics and reporting features
5. **Privacy Compliance**: Maintains local-only data storage model

## Implementation Details

### Database Schema
```javascript
// Sessions Object Store
{
  id: string (primary key),
  type: 'focus' | 'shortBreak' | 'longBreak',
  startTime: Date,
  endTime: Date,
  plannedDuration: number,
  actualDuration: number,
  completed: boolean,
  round: number,
  notes: string,
  date: string (YYYY-MM-DD, indexed)
}

// Indexes
- type: for filtering by session type
- startTime: for date range queries
- date: for daily aggregations
- completed: for completion rate calculations
```

### Integration Points
- **Session Recording**: Automatic capture via timer store lifecycle events
- **Statistics Calculation**: Real-time aggregation using indexed queries
- **UI Components**: React hooks providing reactive statistics updates
- **Data Management**: Built-in export/import and cleanup utilities

## Consequences

### Positive
- Enables rich productivity analytics and insights
- Maintains privacy-first architecture with local-only storage
- Provides foundation for advanced features like goal tracking and habit formation
- Excellent query performance for time-based analytics
- Supports data export for user autonomy

### Negative
- Increased complexity in data layer
- Requires IndexedDB expertise for maintenance
- Additional testing complexity for asynchronous database operations
- Potential browser compatibility considerations for older browsers

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Complexity**: Comprehensive wrapper utilities and clear abstractions
- **Testing**: Extensive mock-based testing for all database operations
- **Fallback**: Graceful degradation when IndexedDB is unavailable
- **Documentation**: Clear API documentation and usage examples

## Alternatives Considered
- **Hybrid Approach**: localStorage for settings, IndexedDB for history (rejected due to complexity)
- **File System API**: Not supported across all browsers
- **Third-party solutions**: Contradicts privacy-first principle

## Future Considerations
- Database schema migrations for feature evolution
- Performance optimization with Web Workers for heavy calculations
- Data archiving strategies for long-term users
- Integration with potential future offline-sync capabilities
