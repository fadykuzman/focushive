## Technical Architecture

### Data Storage (Local Only)
**Current Storage**: Browser localStorage via Zustand persist middleware
- Key: `"focushive-timer"`
- Data stored:
  - Timer state (timeLeft, isActive, isPaused, mode, round)
  - User preferences (focusDuration, shortBreakDuration, longBreakDuration)
  - Settings (totalRounds, autoTimerStart, lastTick)

### Performance Optimizations
- Smooth progress animation using requestAnimationFrame
- Efficient state updates with Zustand
- Component memoization where applicable
- Minimal re-renders through proper dependency management

## Technical Considerations for Local Storage Features

### IndexedDB Benefits
- **Large Storage Capacity**: Gigabytes vs localStorage's ~5-10MB
- **Structured Queries**: Complex data relationships and filtering
- **Performance**: Asynchronous operations, better for large datasets
- **Data Types**: Store binary data, dates, and complex objects
- **Transactions**: ACID compliance for data integrity

### Implementation Recommendations
1. **Use localStorage for**: Simple settings, preferences, small configuration data
2. **Use IndexedDB for**: Historical data, analytics, large datasets, structured queries
3. **Privacy-First Design**: All processing remains client-side
4. **Progressive Enhancement**: Features work offline and enhance experience
5. **Export Capabilities**: Always provide data export to prevent vendor lock-in

### Development Architecture
- **Database Layer**: Abstract IndexedDB operations with utility classes
- **Migration System**: Handle schema changes for IndexedDB
- **Backup/Restore**: Built-in data export/import functionality
- **Performance**: Lazy loading for heavy analytics features
- **Privacy**: No telemetry or tracking, transparent data handling
